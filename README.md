# Wikipedia Rare Diseases Pageviews Analysis

## Objective

The goal of this project is to collect and analyze pageview statistics from Wikipedia for articles related to rare diseases. Data is gathered through the Wikimedia Pageviews API, covering both mobile and desktop views from July 2015 up to the most recent available month. By analyzing this data, we aim to identify patterns and trends in how users engage with these rare disease articles.

## Source Data Licensing

The data used in this project is made available under the terms provided by the Wikimedia Foundation. The data is openly accessible, adhering to Wikimedia’s terms of use, which you can review here: [Wikimedia Foundation Terms of Use](https://foundation.wikimedia.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use).

The dataset collected respects the privacy guidelines set by Wikimedia, containing only public pageview information with no personal identifiers.

## API Reference

For more information about the API used to collect the pageview data, you can visit:
- [Wikimedia Pageviews API Documentation](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/#/Pageviews%20data)

## Data Files Produced

The following files are generated by the data collection scripts:

1. **rare-disease_monthly_mobile_2015070100-2024100100.json**  
   - Mobile pageviews (including web and app) per month for each rare disease article.
   
2. **rare-disease_monthly_desktop_2015070100-2024100100.json**  
   - Desktop pageview data per month for each rare disease article.

3. **rare-disease_monthly_all-types_2015070100-2024100100.json**  
   - Cumulative pageviews combining mobile and desktop access for each article, recorded monthly.

## Data Structure

The generated data follows this format:

- **article_title**: Name of the Wikipedia article.
- **timestamp**: Year and month (YYYYMM format) for the recorded pageviews.
- **views**: Total number of views for the article during that month.

## Known Limitations

- Some articles may have missing data for specific months, likely due to gaps in pageviews or API unavailability.
- API requests might occasionally fail due to rate limiting by the server, leading to fewer data points than expected for some articles.

## Steps to Reproduce

If you want to replicate this analysis on your local machine, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the Repository

Begin by downloading the code from the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/divyamagr/data-512-homework_1.git
cd data-512-homework_1
```


### 2. Fetch and Analyze the Data

To gather pageview data, run the notebook that handles data acquisition:

```bash
jupyter notebook main.ipynb
```

This script will:
- Collect monthly desktop and mobile pageviews for each article.
- Save the data in the `data/` directory as JSON files:
  - `rare-disease_monthly_mobile_2015070100-2024100100.json`
  - `rare-disease_monthly_desktop_2015070100-2024100100.json`
  - `rare-disease_monthly_all-types_2015070100-2024100100.json`
- Parse the collected JSON data.
- Generate graphs illustrating pageview trends such as:
  - Highest and lowest average pageviews.
  - Top 10 articles by peak pageviews.
  - Articles with missing months of data.
- Save the graphs in PNG format under the `images/` folder

### 4. Outputs

The project will generate the following files:

- **Data Files**:
  - `rare-disease_monthly_mobile_2015070100-2024100100.json`: Mobile view data.
  - `rare-disease_monthly_desktop_2015070100-2024100100.json`: Desktop view data.
  - `rare-disease_monthly_all-types_2015070100-2024100100.json`: Combined pageviews.
  
- **Graphs**:
  - `max_min_avg_views.png`: Graph showing maximum and minimum average views for desktop and mobile.
  - `top_10_peak_views.png`: Graph of the top 10 peak pageviews for articles.
  - `fewest_months_data.png`: Graph showing articles with the fewest months of data.

## Known Issues

- **Incomplete Data**: Some articles may not have complete monthly data due to creation after July 2015 or no pageviews recorded for specific months.
- **API Rate Limiting**: If the Wikimedia API rate limit is reached, requests may fail. Adding delays between requests can help mitigate this issue.
